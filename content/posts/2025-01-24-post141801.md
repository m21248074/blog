## Level Goal

A daemon is listening on port 30002 and will give you the password for bandit25 if given the password for bandit24 and a secret numeric 4-digit pincode. There is no way to retrieve the pincode except by going through all of the 10000 combinations, called brute-forcing.
You do not need to create new connections each time

## My Answer (Step by step)

1. 連線到伺服器並登入

```bash
ssh bandit24@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

2. 透過 mktemp 指令產生暫存資料夾，並透過 cd 指令進入它

```bash
mktemp -d
cd /tmp/tmp.xs599rbycC
```

3. 透過 vim, vi, nano 等指令產生稍後要執行的腳本檔，並透過 chmod 指令修改權限以便執行

```bash
nano a.sh
```

a.sh

```bash
#!/bin/bash
PWD='gb8KRRCsshuZXI0tUuR6ypOFjiZbf3G8'
for n in `seq 1 9999`;
do
    echo "$PWD $n"
done | nc localhost 30002
```

```bash
chmod 777 -R /tmp/tmp.xs599rbycC
```

4. 執行它，即可獲得 Level 25 密碼!

```bash
./a.sh
