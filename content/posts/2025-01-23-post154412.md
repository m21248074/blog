## Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in **/etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 and can only be read by user bandit14**. For this level, you don’t get the next password, but you get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level. **Note: localhost** is a hostname that refers to the machine you are working on

### Commands you may need to solve this level

- ssh
- telnet
- nc
- openssl
- s_client
- nmap

## My Answer (Step by step)

1. 連線到伺服器並登入

```bash
ssh bandit13@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

2. 透過 ls 指令可以看到當前目錄有通往下一個等級的SSH密鑰

```bash
ls
# sshkey.private
```

3. 透過 ssh 指令連線到 bandit14

```bash
ssh bandit14@localhost -p 2220 -i sshkey.private
```

4. 透過 cat 指令查看 Level 14 密碼!

```bash
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14
```
