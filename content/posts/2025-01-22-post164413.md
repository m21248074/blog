## Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in the file **data.txt** and is the only line of text that occurs only once

### Commands you may need to solve this level

- grep
- sort
- uniq
- strings
- base64
- tr
- tar
- gzip
- bzip2
- xxd

## My Answer (Step by step)

1. 連線到伺服器並登入

```bash
ssh bandit8@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

2. 透過 sort 與 uniq 指令，從 data.txt 檔案內容找尋 Level 9 密碼!

```bash
sort data.txt | uniq -u
```
