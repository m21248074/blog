## Level Goal

The goal of this level is for you to log into the game using SSH. The host to which you need to connect is **bandit.labs.overthewire.org**, on port 2220. The username is **bandit0** and the password is **bandit0**. Once logged in, go to the Level 1 page to find out how to beat Level 1.

The password for the next level is stored in a file called **readme** located in the home directory. Use this password to log into bandit1 using SSH. Whenever you find a password for a level, use SSH (on port 2220) to log into that level and continue the game.
