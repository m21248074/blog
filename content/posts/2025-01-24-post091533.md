## Level Goal

There are 2 files in the homedirectory: **passwords.old and passwords.new**. The password for the next level is in **passwords.new** and is the only line that has been changed between **passwords.old and passwords.new**

**NOTE: if you have solved this level and see ‘Byebye!’ when trying to log into bandit18, this is related to the next level, bandit19**

### Commands you may need to solve this level

- cat
- grep
- ls
- diff

## My Answer (Step by step)

1. 連線到伺服器並登入

```bash
ssh bandit17@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

2. 透過 diff 指令比對新舊密碼的差異，即可找到 Level 18 密碼!

```bash
diff passwords.new passwords.old
# 42c42
# < x2gLTTjFwMOhQ8oWNbMN362QKxfRqGlO
