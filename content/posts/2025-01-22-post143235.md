## Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in a file called **spaces in this filename** located in the home directory

### Commands you may need to solve this level

- ls
- cd
- cat
- file
- du
- find

## My Answer (Step by step)

1. 連線到伺服器並登入

```bash
ssh bandit2@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

2. 透過 ls 指令會看到 spaces in this filename 檔案

```bash
ls
```

3. 透過 cat 指令讀取 spaces in this filename 檔案即可看到 Level 3 密碼!

```bash
cat "spaces in this filename"
```
